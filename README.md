# Theme Starter Kit

This repo contains a script, `generatetheme.sh`, which will set up a new environment for you to build a Neto theme!

It also acts as a repository for themeScripts which are used within the themes to compile, update and upload stuff. You shouldn't run these scripts within this repositoryâ€”they are just here for version control and storage.

## How to use

To build a new theme, simply navigate to this repository in terminal and run the following command:

```
bash generatetheme.sh
```

This will create a new directory, outside of but adjacent to this directory, called `newTheme`. It will have everything you need set-up.

Note that you need Node.js installed, and gulp.js installed globally to run this script successfully.
